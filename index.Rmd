## Introduction

The Twitter platform has gained millions of users from all around the world and it is generating an endless stream of data.
Although Twitter is also used routinely by PR departments of corporations, universities, and heads of states to propagate
their agendas to public, the majority of tweets still comes from regular users and can possibly be utilized as a probe of
a "public mood" on a variety of subjects.

A simple [Shiny application](https://koskot77.shinyapps.io/twitter/) allows one to perform basic text mining operations
on a sample of relatively new tweets coming from various places. Below I'll give you an insight on how to use this
application. If you are not familiar with the Text Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) method, think of it
as a reweighting technique that allows one to rank down "low information" words like "the", "and", or "have" and rank up
infrequent, possibly informative words.

Unfortunately I do not have a shiny server on my own. The application data is updated every time you open the link above,
which results in a noticeable delay. Please, bear with a half-minute delay.

## Daily activity

The first two tabs show stacked and decomposed daily activity of the Twitter users:

<img class=center src=activity.png height=200>
<br>
<img class=center src=ts.png height=200>

--- .class #id


## High Weight Words

<img class=center src=topWords.png height=350>
<br>

List of 100 highest TF-IDF words is displayed on `High Weight Words` sub-tab

Document frequency is number of documents (tweets) with the term over total number of documents

--- .class #id


## Associations

One can type a term and query associations (TF-IDF weighted co-occurance) along these lines:

<img class=center src=vodka.png height=330>
<br>

Interestingly, in California `vodka` is also associated to the russian president
